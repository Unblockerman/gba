## Features

Hades is still under heavy development but it aimes to have a decent balance between usability, speed and accuracy.

Currently, Hades features:
  - High accuracy
  - Color correction
  - Game controller support
  - Real Time Clock (RTC) support

It is the third ðŸ¥‰ software emulator to pass the AGS Aging Cartridge used to test Game Boy Advance systems.

## Run

You can download the latest nightly build for your favorite operating system [here](https://nightly.link/Arignir/Hades/workflows/main/master).

You need a game ROM and a legitimate GameBoy Advance BIOS or a [replacement BIOS](https://github.com/Cult-of-GBA/BIOS/blob/master/bios.bin).

Sart Hades, then click on `File` -> `Open BIOS` and select the BIOS (`bios.bin`) you downloaded above.

You can now play all your favorite games! Click on `File` -> `Open` and select the ROM (`<game>.gba`) you want to run.

Alternatively, you can also drag and drop your GBA rom over `hades.exe` (Windows only).

## Build

The build dependencies are:

  - `meson`
  - `ninja`
  - `GCC`
  - `SDL2`
  - `OpenGL`
  - `glew`

On Ubuntu, you can install all those dependencies with:

```bash
$ apt install meson ninja-build gcc libsdl2-dev libglew-dev
```

To build Hades, run:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
meson build
cd build
ninja
```

The binary is located in `build/source/platform/gui/`.
